CQE_DCMD is not necessary to be enabled when CQE is enabled.     (Software could halt CQE to send command)          In the case that CQE_DCMD is not enabled  it still needs to allocate     space for data transfer. For instance:       CQE_DCMD is enabled:  31 slots space (one slot used by DCMD)       CQE_DCMD is disabled: 32 slots space          Fixes: a4080225f51d (""mmc: cqhci: support for command queue enabled host"")     Signed-off-by: Alamy Liu <alamy.liu@gmail.com>     Acked-by: Adrian Hunter <adrian.hunter@intel.com>     Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org     Signed-off-by: Ulf Hansson <ulf.hansson@linaro.org> ",1

"    Support ""-term"" in Ferret engine queries          Summary:     Ref T12819. Supports negating search terms  e.g. ""apple -honeycrisp"".          When negating a term  we're a little more strict about what can match (that is  what can //prevent// a document from being returned) since it's easy for a user to type ""apple -honeycrisp -honey -crisp -crispies -olcrispers -honeyyums"" to keep refining their search  but hard/impossible to split apart an overboard term.

    crypto: caam - fix decryption shared vs. non-shared key setting          Key sharing is enabled by default in the shared descriptor.          Using CBC decrypt  AES has to alter the key in order to decrypt.     During high traffic decryption rates  i.e  when sharing starts to     take place  we need to use a different OPERATION option to tell AES     that the key was already altered by the PRIOR descriptor - we need     the following kind of logic:          if ( shared )         operation where AES uses decryption key (DK=1)     else         operation where AES uses encryption key (DK=0)          this patch implements this logic using a conditional and     a non-conditional local jump within the decryption job     descriptor.

Notice that this constant is used in a context that     expects an expression of type u64.

Also  once the expression is properly evaluated using 64-bit arithmentic      there is no need for the parentheses and the external cast to u64.

"    mvumi: 64bit value for seconds_since1970          struct mvumi_hs_page2 stores a ""seconds_since1970"" field which is of     type u64. It is however  written to  using 'struct timeval' which has     a 32-bit seconds field and whose value will overflow in year 2038.
