    [ALSA] Improve SPDIF playback via the P16V/CA0151 chip.          EMU10K1/EMU10K2 driver     Although we can set 44100 as the output rate  the SPDIF can do it  but the Analog output cannot.     The SPDIF has the bug  whereby the Left channel arrives one sample late  so although we don't do any resampling      it is not good for AC3 non-audio output.

    [SPARK-14786] Remove hive-cli dependency from hive subproject          The `hive` subproject currently depends on `hive-cli` in order to perform a check to see whether a `SessionState` is an instance of `org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.CliSessionState` (see #9589). The introduction of this `hive-cli` dependency has caused problems for users whose Hive metastore JAR classpaths don't include the `hive-cli` classes (such as in #11495).          This patch removes this dependency on `hive-cli` and replaces the `isInstanceOf` check by reflection. I added a Maven Enforcer rule to ban `hive-cli` from the `hive` subproject in order to make sure that this dependency is not accidentally reintroduced.          /cc rxin yhuai adrian-wang preecet          Author: Josh Rosen <joshrosen@databricks.com>          Closes #12551 from JoshRosen/remove-hive-cli-dep-from-hive-subproject. ,1

    Safe instanceof should elide nullable          Summary:     Currently it's the case that `instanceof` tests on locals that have a nullable type do not glean     concrete information about type parameters. For example  if `$x` has type `?Base<T>`  and we do `$x instanceof Derived`  then the type of `$x` is refined to `Derived<T#1>` with no information about `T#1`. In the case that `Base` is invariant  it should be possible to determine `T=T#1`. To fix this  we add a new rule to the decomposition of a subtype assumption: if we know that `C<ts> <: ?D<ts'>` for classish types `C` and `D`  then it must be the case that `C<ts> <: D<ts'>`.

    [PATCH] Reclaim slab during zone reclaim          If large amounts of zone memory are used by empty slabs then zone_reclaim     becomes uneffective.  This patch shakes the slab a bit.          The problem with this patch is that the slab reclaim is not containable to a     zone.  Thus slab reclaim may affect the whole system and be extremely slow.     This also means that we cannot determine how many pages were freed in this     zone.  Thus we need to go off node for at least one allocation.          The functionality is disabled by default.          We could modify the shrinkers to take a zone parameter but that would be quite     invasive.  Better ideas are welcome.

I thought about  in     this same commit  changing the SIGTERM in     maybe_restart_mirroring_script to a SIGINT  but after tracing out the     code paths  I realized that isn't necessary. (The SIGTERM is     necessarily performed on a process that has not subscribed to any     zephyr classes  so cancelSubs is unnecessary. If we do think that we     may want to add additional clean-up operations in the future  though      then it might be worth investigating changing this SIGTERM.)

    Integration of Mike Alsup's excellent form serialization code. The benefits are as follows:          - New method: .serializeArray()     This returns an array of name/value pairs representing the contents of a form  or individual input elements.     - Enhancement: .serialize()     The results are correct now (as opposed to the mess from before)  and allows you to serializes forms directly (rather than just the input elements).     - Enhancement: .val()     This now returns the correct value when dealing wih selects. Additionally  when dealing with multiple selects  it returns an array of values.          Based upon Mike's code:     http://malsup.com/jquery/form/comp/form.js          and test suite:     http://malsup.com/jquery/form/comp/test.html ,1

It turns out that this is due to non-synced TSC and the queued remote     wakeups stopped coupeling the two relevant cpu clocks  which leads to     wakeups seeing time jumps  which in turn lead to skewed runtime stats.          Add an explicit call to sched_clock_cpu() to couple the per-cpu clocks     to restore the normal flow of time.

    fix(ivy): fix class inheritance detection for ES5 code in `ngtsc` (#28773)          Previously  `ngtsc` detected class inheritance in a way that only worked     in TS or ES2015 code. As a result  inheritance would not be detected for     code in ES5 format  such as when running `ngtsc` through `ngcc` to     transform old-style Angular code to ivy format.

    USB: xHCI: update ring dequeue pointer when process missed tds          This patch fixes a isoc transfer bug reported by Sander Eikelenboom.     When ep->skip is set  endpoint ring dequeue pointer should be updated     when processed every missed td. Although ring dequeue pointer will also     be updated when ep->skip is clear  leave it intact during missed tds     processing may cause two issues:          1). If the very next valid transfer following missed tds is a short     transfer  its actual_length will be miscalculated;     2). If there are too many missed tds during transfer  new inserted tds     may found the transfer ring full and urb enqueue fails.

"    threaded-resolver: never use NULL hints with getaddrinfo          The net effect of this bug as it appeared to users  would be that     libcurl would timeout in the connect phase.          When disabling IPv6 use but still using getaddrinfo  libcurl would     wrongly not init the ""hints"" struct field in init_thread_sync() which     would subsequently lead to a getaddrinfo() invoke with a zeroed hints     with ai_socktype set to 0 instead of SOCK_STREAM. This would lead to     different behaviors on different platforms but basically incorrect     output.          This code was introduced in 483ff1ca75cbea  released in curl 7.20.0.          This bug became a problem now due to the happy eyeballs code and how     libcurl now traverses the getaddrinfo() results differently.

    Avoid cycles when unpickling the stdlib from TASTY          `adjustForTuple` shouldn't be used when unpickling Java (because the     Tuple classes are always defined in .scala files) nor when unpickling     TASTY (because at that point  `adjustForTuple` has already been called     by Namer before pickling). This avoids some cycles when unpickling     the standard library from TASTY (we don't have a published     Dotty-compiled standard library yet  but trying to use incremental     compilation in the stdlib that is part of our community build is enough     to trigger the issue).          Note: This won't handle the hypothetical future case of Scala 2     generated TASTY files which wouldn't have the extra parents  but let's not     worry about that for now. ,0

"    Close extraneous file descriptors in containers          Without this patch  containers inherit the open file descriptors of the daemon  so my ""exec 42>&2"" allows us to ""echo >&42 some nasty error with some bad advice"" directly into the daemon log. :)          Also  ""hack/dind"" was already doing this due to issues caused by the inheritance  so I'm removing that hack too since this patch obsoletes it by generalizing it for all containers.

    [cleanup] Remove a lot of dead intrinsics/runtime functions.          The following runtime functions (and their intrinsic counter parts) are     completely unused/obsolete by now            - %ToInteger       - %GeneratorGetInputOrDebugPos          and in addition the intrinsics for %_ToNumber and %_IsJSProxy are also     dead (according to code coverage and manual verification)  so drop them     as well (their runtime function counterparts are still somewhat used).

"    pkt-line: check write_in_full() errors against ""< 0""          As with the previous two commits  we prefer to check     write_in_full()'s return value to see if it is negative      rather than comparing it to the input length.          These cases actually flip the logic to check for success      making conversion a little different than in other cases. We     could of course write:            if (write_in_full(...) >= 0)               return 0;       return error(...);          But our usual method of spelling write() error checks is     just ""< 0"". So let's flip the logic for each of these     conditionals to our usual style.

"    encoding/asn1: respect “explicit” and “tag” when unmarshaling RawValues.          Previously  any “explicit” and/or “tag” decorations on a RawValue would     be ignored when unmarshaling. The RawValue would swallow whatever     element was encountered.          This change causes these decorations to be respected. Thus a field like:       Foo asn1.RawValue `asn1:""explicit tag:1 optional""`     will only match if an explicit tag with value one is encountered.     Otherwise the RawValue will get the default value and parsing will move     onto the next element.          Thanks to Martin Kreichgauer for reporting the issue.

    sctp: return back transport in __sctp_rcv_init_lookup          Prior to this patch  it used a local variable to save the transport that is     looked up by __sctp_lookup_association()  and didn't return it back. But in     sctp_rcv  it is used to initialize chunk->transport. So when hitting this      even if it found the transport  it was still initializing chunk->transport     with null instead.

    [AIRFLOW-1366] Add max_tries to task instance          Right now Airflow deletes the task instance when     user clear it. We have no way of keeping track of     how many times a task instance gets run either via     user or itself. So instead of deleting the task     instance record  we should keep the task instance     and make try_number monotonically increasing for     every task instance attempt. max_tries is     introduced as an upper bound for retrying tasks by     task itself.          This new column will be used to update logic     behind clear_task_instances.          db migration is tested locally.          Closes #2409 from AllisonWang/allison--max-tries ,0

    Use mmap for FileCache.          Summary:     I made the change as Paul suggested to mmap the file cache and then use     posix_madvise to let the kernel free the memory that's occupied by the     file cache on the grounds that the content of the file cache is rarely     used. Each time we use a static content file  the corresponding memory     will be loaded on-demand by the kernel from the disk file. After we     send back the response  posix_madvise is called again.

    [split] finagle-thrift: Do not rely on ThreadLocal'd ClientIds in TTwitterFilter          The most recent ClientIdContext release caused issues seemingly related to the     ThreadLocal'd ClientIds set implicitly by ClientIdContext.          This change has two parts:          - Client-side: In TTwitterFilter  pass the constructor-supplied ClientId as the       value to ClientIdContext rather than relying on the implicitly supplied by       `Context.emit()`.     - Server-side: Put precedence of `header.client_id` above the ClientId embedded       in `header.contexts`. These two values *should* be equal in all cases  but       they don't seem to be in this macaw-relevance/Gizmoduck case. In this observed       case  putting precedence on the non-context-based ClientId will fix the       failure mode in currently-deployed services.          RB_ID=301507 ,1

"    pinctrl: sunxi: add a missing function of A10/A20 pinctrl driver          The PH16 pin has a function with mux id 0x5  which is the DET pin of the     ""sim"" (smart card reader) IP block.          This function is missing in old versions of A10/A20 SoCs' datasheets and     user manuals  so it's also missing in the old drivers. The newest A10     Datasheet V1.70 and A20 Datasheet V1.41 contain this pin function  and     it's discovered during implementing R40 pinctrl driver.          Add it to the driver. As we now merged A20 pinctrl driver to the A10     one  we need to only fix the A10 driver now.

    Add two helpful command-line options for debugging function passes.          This commit adds -sil-break-on-function and -sil-break-on-pass  both     -Xllvm options.          -sil-break-on-function stops function pass execution in the debugger      just prior to running each function pass on a particular function.          -sil-break-on-pass stops function pass execution in the debugger just      prior to running a particular pass on each function.          Used together  you can break just prior running a particular pass on a     particular function.          For example:       xcrun lldb -- $(/path/to/my/swiftc -c -O problem.swift -###) -Xllvm -sil-break-on-function=_TF7problem7problemFT_T_ -Xllvm -sil-break-on-pass='Simplify CFG'          Now when running under the debugger  we'll stop execution just prior     to each run of Simplify CFG on the function problem() in     problem.swift. ,0

    md: clear In_sync bit on devices added to an active array.          When we add a device to an active array it can be meaningful to set     the 'insync' flag.  This indicates that the device is in-sync with the     array except for locations recorded in the bitmap.     A bitmap-based recovery can then bring it completely in-sync.          Internally we move that flag to 'saved_raid_disk' but forgot to clear     In_sync like we do in add_new_disk.          So clear In_sync after moving its value to saved_raid_disk.

    power: reset: ltc2952: make trigger input optional          Currently the ltc2952 supports only one button sequence to initiate     powerdown. This is not always desirable  as even prolonged button     presses can happen in use.          Allow ltc2952 users to pick their own power down sequence  by making the     trigger input optional. Since this still means that the ltc2952 may     power down the platform if the power button is pressed for about 5     seconds  we still need to make sure to start the watchdog toggle to     prolong the system power for as long as we need it.

    Switch over to using our own qsort() all the time  as has been proposed     repeatedly.  Now that we don't have to worry about memory leaks from     glibc's qsort  we can safely put CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS into the tuplesort     comparators  as was requested a couple months ago.  Also  get rid of     non-reentrancy and an extra level of function call in tuplesort.c by     providing a variant qsort_arg() API that passes an extra void * argument     through to the comparison routine.  (We might want to use that in other     places too  I didn't look yet.) ,0

    Fix downstream client API build errors on Solaris          The client API at fsouza/go-dockerclient has dependencies on packages in     the docker/docker repository which currently do not build on Solaris.

Otherwise the driver     may end up trying to control a codec which is not powered up.          Remove that dependency on initialization order by handling the error.

    Clear bindings on ViewHolders when the RecyclerView is detached.          Keep WeakReferences of all ViewHolders created by the adapter.  When the     associated RecyclerView is detached from the window we clear the bindings.     Note that this does not Dispose of the ViewHolder since the Adapter doesn't     really manage the lifetime of the ViewHolder and there is no callback for     when the ViewHolder is destroyed.          Without this we leak target bindings.          Fixes https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross/issues/1379 ,1

    ConnectivityServiceTest: fix flaky testNetworkRequestMaximum          Registered requests are not keyed by PendingIntents in     ConnectivityService  which means that unregistering a request with a     PendingIntent causes a linear search in all registered requests.          testNetworkRequestMaximum was registering too many PendingIntents     simultaneously  causing the unregistration loop to have n^2     complexity and to take a long time to take effect.          To make the unregistering loop less likely to trigger a timeout on     waitForIdle  this patch changes the test to not register MAX_REQUEST     number of PendingIntent  but instead mixes a small number of     PendingIntents with NetworkCallbacks to reach MAX_REQUEST number of     simultaneously registered requests.          When unregistering these requests  callbacks are unregistered first.          Bug: 32561414     Test: runtest frameworks-net     Change-Id: I48b882c884abe20b388190b7f28baee293446f37 ,0

MLlib ```LinearRegression/LogisticRegression/LinearSVC``` always standardize the data during training to improve the rate of convergence regardless of _standardization_ is true or false. If _standardization_ is false  we perform reverse standardization by penalizing each component differently to get effectively the same objective function when the training dataset is not standardized.

Thanks go to Vlad for starting this work.          Intel 82576 chipset supports SCTP checksum offloading.  This     patch enables this functionality in the driver.  A new NETIF     feature is introduced for SCTP checksum offload.  If the driver     supports CRC32c checksum  it can set this feature flag.  The     hardware can offload both transmit and receive.

    Add a SHOW command to the replication command language.          This is useful infrastructure for an upcoming proposed patch to     allow the WAL segment size to be changed at initdb time; tools like     pg_basebackup need the ability to interrogate the server setting.     But it also doesn't seem like a bad thing to have independently of     that; it may find other uses in the future.          Robert Haas and Beena Emerson.  (The original patch here was by     Beena  but I rewrote it to such a degree that most of the code     being committed here is mine.)

    Fix: Force workspaces to always be installed from their root (#4030)          **Summary**          Fixes #4028.          - When installing  we will now always start installing from the root of the workspace  or the cwd if there's none (which is what defines `lockfileFolder`).          - The relative paths are now resolved when reading the JSON files rather than when resolving them. It allows us to factor the logic  and I think it also solves a pair of issues where relative subdependencies were not correctly resolved when installed from non-`link:` and non-`file:` dependencies (this is only my belief based on my lecture of the source code  I haven't yet took the time to validate this hypothesis).          **Test plan**          Added integration tests. ,1

    Fixed issue with associating WindowToken with null binder.          App don't have to specify a LayoutParams.token when adding a window to     the system  however when they don't WM maps all the windows to a single     WindowToken mapped to a null IBinder. This isn't correct since the     windows can be coming from different apps and also null binder shouldn't     be used to map tokens.     We now:     1. Associate the WindowToken with the IWindow client for bookkeeping in     WM if the app didn't specify LayoutParams.token for the window it is     adding.     2. Throw an illegal argumenet exception we we try to associate a null     binder with a window token or null window token with a binder on a     display.

Some code -- I am not sure which -- has been changed  so that the     `<<-` part of the regex is no longer necessary. There specs that cover     the heredocs are still in place though (and the code works with the     `<<` style heredoc as well  by the way).
